# Basic Calculator

## Author
Harshada Ganesh Tupe

## Description
The Basic Calculator is a simple Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations. It allows users to enter two numbers and choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). The program then performs the selected operation and displays the result.

## Features
- Addition of two numbers.
- Subtraction of two numbers.
- Multiplication of two numbers.
- Division of two numbers with error handling for division by zero.

## Installation

To use this program, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/t-harshada01/Simple_Calculator.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd basic-calculator
   ```
3. **Ensure you have Python installed.** The program is compatible with Python 3.6 and above. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

## Usage

1. **Run the Program:**
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```
2. **Follow the Prompts:**
   - Enter the first number.
   - Enter the second number.
   - Choose an operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
   - View the result displayed.

## Example

```text
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Choose an operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide): add

Result: 15
```

## Code Example

Here’s a snippet of the code that performs the calculations:

```python
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

def subtract(x, y):
    return x - y

def multiply(x, y):
    return x * y

def divide(x, y):
    if y == 0:
        return "Error! Division by zero."
    return x / y

def main():
    print("Basic Calculator")
    
    try:
        num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
        num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
        
        operation = input("Choose an operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide): ").strip().lower()
        
        if operation == 'add':
            print("Result:", add(num1, num2))
        elif operation == 'subtract':
            print("Result:", subtract(num1, num2))
        elif operation == 'multiply':
            print("Result:", multiply(num1, num2))
        elif operation == 'divide':
            print("Result:", divide(num1, num2))
        else:
            print("Invalid operation selected.")
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input! Please enter numerical values.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
